# TBQA
This is the dataset we described in ‘One vs. Many QA Matching with both Word-level and Sentence-level Attention network’.
We split the dataset into three parts and shuffle the QA pairs: train.txt, valid.txt and test.txt.
Each file has three columns: question, answer and label.
PS: '|' in these files means space(' ').
